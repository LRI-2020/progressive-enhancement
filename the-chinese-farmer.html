            <h2> The story</h2>
            <p id="storyp1">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his
                neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</p>
            <blockquote>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</blockquote>
            <p>The farmer said,</p>
            <blockquote><em>Maybe.</em></blockquote>


            <p> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came
                back and said</p>
            <blockquote>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</blockquote>
            <p>The farmeragain said,</p>
            <blockquote><em>Maybe.</em></blockquote>


            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
                his leg. The neighbors then said,</p>
            <blockquote>Oh dear, that’s too <bad-good-word class="Bad">bad</bad-good-word></blockquote>
            <p>and the farmer responded,</p>
            <blockquote><em>Maybe.</em></blockquote>

            <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected
                his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p>
            <blockquote>isn’t that great!</blockquote>
            <p>Again, he said,</p>
            <blockquote><em>Maybe.</em></blockquote>

            <p><b><i>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
                        impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <bag-good-word
