            <h2> The story</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
                around to commiserate. <br>They said,
            <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
            The farmer said,
            <q><em>Maybe.</em></q>
            </p>

            </p> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came
            back and said<br>
            <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> <br>The farmeragain said,<q><em>Maybe.</em></q>
            </p>

            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. 
            <br>The neighbors then said,<q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded,<q><em>Maybe.</em></q></p>

            <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.<br> Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>isn’t that great!</q><br> Again, he said, <q><em>Maybe.</em></q></p>

            <p><blockquote>whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be theconsequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.<br>Alan Watts</blockquote> </p>

                    bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
